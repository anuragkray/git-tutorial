# Git tutorial
Git is a free and open-source version control system.
1. Git helps developers track code changes, work together easily, and go back to previous versions if needed. 
2. It allows multiple people to work on different features at the same time. 
3. Git also keeps code safe and helps with automation, making software development faster, easier, and more organized.
### In simple word
- Tracks Changes â€“ Git saves different versions of your code, so you can go back if needed.
- Works Offline â€“ You donâ€™t need the internet to use Git on your computer.
- Team Collaboration â€“ Many people can work on the same project without messing up each otherâ€™s code.
- Branching â€“ You can create separate branches to test new features without affecting the main code.
- Safe & Fast â€“ Git keeps your code safe and makes software development quick and organized.
